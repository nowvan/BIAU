# libp2p running in the Browser

One of the primary goals with libp2p P2P was to get it fully working in the browser and interopable with the versions running in Go and in Node.js.

# 1. Setting up a simple app that lists connections to other nodes

Simple go into the folder [1](./1) and execute the following

```bash
> cd 1
> npm install
> npm start
# open your browser in port :9090
```
